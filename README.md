# Oktoberfest Challenge.

## About.
- This website was made for a challenge proposed by IMED, where we had to create a landing page for an event from Rio Grande do Sul.
- We used only HTML5, CSS3 and JS without any framework.
- Responsiveness, keyframes, and some JS dynamism along with some coffee made it possible.
